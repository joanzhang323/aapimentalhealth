README.TXT FILE FOR AAPI MENTAL FINAL PROJECT for CS 171 - FALL 2016

OUR CODE:
-index.html: contains outline for the website structure and layout
    -Also contains code for our various other visualization aspects including our gallery of images that and carousel displaying
        the compiled images from our peers.
-racialComparison.js: Code for our first visualization comparing the mental health prevalence among different demographic groups
-suicideChart.js: second visualization showing a suicide process model and how various interventions can potentially shift people from
                    losing their life to suicide to saving their lives from the intervention. The squares were shifted based on whether the
                    individual from our data set had 1) suicidal thoughts 2) suicide plans or 3) suicide attempts. The first intervention shifts
                    individuals from the first and second category because talking to a friend may likely to not only alleviate suicidal thoughts,
                    but also prevent those individuals from later forming suicidal plans. The second button moves individuals from all three categories
                    because seeing a professional therapist at any stage can potentially help prevent individuals at any point in the suicide process.
                    The third button/intervention only moves individuals from the third group (suicide attempt), because this intervention is typically
                    not utilized until an emergency is in place and is less preventative, but equally vital at the most severe level.
